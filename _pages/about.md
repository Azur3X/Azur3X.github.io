My name is Mathias Bonde Jensen, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark. I also go by the online handle Azur3x across various platforms. This portfolio provides an overview of my academic achievements and projects, many of which are showcased on my GitHub

I have completed numerous hobby projects that have allowed me to explore and deepen my understanding of various areas within computer science. I am passionate about learning new technologies and enjoy sharing knowledge with others.

As a dedicated Linux enthusiast, I have a special interest in networking and cybersecurity. I actively manage and self-host my own home server, which helps me apply practical skills in real-world scenarios.

My love for mathematics fuels my analytical thinking, and I appreciate the broad scope of topics within the CS field. I am particularly fascinated by optimization, whether itâ€™s refining workflows, creating shortcuts, or enhancing system performance.

I invite you to explore my portfolio to learn more about my skills, interests, and contributions.
